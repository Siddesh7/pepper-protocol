# ðŸ¥µ Pepper Protocol

**Trading fan tokens shouldn't be a nightmare.**  
Todayâ€™s cross-chain bridging and lending/borrowing experience is slow, fragmented, and not designed for sports fans who just want to support their team or trade fan tokens with ease.

## âš½ What is Pepper Protocol?

**Pepper Protocol** is a multipurpose cross-chain protocol purpose-built for fan tokens. We make it ridiculously easy to **lend, borrow, and swap** across chains â€” especially into the **Chiliz chain**, where most fan tokens live.

No more endless hops between chains just to buy a $JUV or $PSG token. With Pepper, you can stay on your favorite chain (like Base or Ethereum), and still get what you need.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- **One-click cross-chain swaps:**
